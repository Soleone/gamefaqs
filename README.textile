h3. Requirements

only *Hpricot* so far

h3. Issues

It is not that fast, because sometimes there have to be multiple webpages parsed at once. For example to retrieve the names of all games for a platform, at least 26 pages need to be parsed (one for each letter of the alphabet).

Maybe speed can be worked on with better caching in the future.
